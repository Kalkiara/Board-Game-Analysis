## Project Organization
The organization of the project is as follows:


```
├── README.md                <- The top-level README for this project
├── data                     <- Folder containing behavioral data
|   ├── xx                   <- xx
|   └── xx                   <- xx
├── src                      <- The main folder for scripts
|   ├── xx                   <- xx
|   └── xx                   <- xx
├── .gitignore               <- A list of files not uploaded to git
└── xx                       <- xx
```

## Reproducibility
